# What?
## What is this?
It's my opinionated take on a boilerplate React/Webpack/Redux app. I plan on using it as a boilerplate for future projects. It's also my record of how to setup and configure these things; you'll see the commit notes are (kind of) detailed. It's my lazy way of writing a blog, but not.

# How (to use this)? 
## Environment:
I'm currently using:

 - node v7.9.0
 - npm v4.2.0
 - yarn 0.19.1

## Install:
 - run `yarn install`
 - run `yarn build`

## Run:
 - run `yarn start` 
 - Open `localhost:8080` in your browser of choice 
 - run `yarn watch` in another terminal window if you want webpack to watch and automatically rerun on change 

# Why?
## Why not use {{insert react boilerplate app name here}}?
Because I need to learn how to use Webpack, Babel, (the newer version of) React, Redux and React Router. Doing things is the best way to learn things `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
 
## Why is it called `shiny-invention`?
Because Github generates the best repository names.
